moon-buggy - drive some car across the moon

INTRODUCTION:

   Moon-buggy is a simple character graphics game, where you drive some
kind of car across the moon's surface.  Unfortunately there are
dangerous craters there.  Fortunately your car can jump over them!

   The game is not yet finished.  So be prepared to encounter bugs (and
please report them).  But it works to some extent, it has a top-ten
list, and it may be fun.  Just try it!

   Moon-Buggy comes with NO WARRANTY, to the extent permitted by law.
You may redistribute copies of Moon-Buggy under the terms of the GNU
General Public License.  For more information about these matters, read
the file COPYING of the source code distribution or press `c' at
moon-buggy's title screen.

   Please mail any suggestions and bug reports to
<voss@mathematik.uni-kl.de>.  Your message should include the
moon-buggy version number, as obtained by the command `moon-buggy -V'.


INSTALLATION:

   Generic installation instructions are in the file INSTALL.  There
are some points of interest:

   * By default, the program will be installed as
     `/usr/local/bin/moon-buggy'.  You can specify an installation
     prefix other than `/usr/local' by giving `configure' the
     `--prefix=PATH' option.

   * You can choose the score file's location via `configure''s
     `--sharedstatedir' option.  On Linux you should use
          --sharedstatedir=/var/games
     to comply with the Filesystem Hierarchy Standard.

   * Moon-buggy supports shared score files.  As explained in
     moon-buggy's manual, you may want to make moon-buggy a setuid
     program.  This can be done with the `--with-setuid' option.  If
     you use
          --with-setuid=games
     then the user `games' owns the `moon-buggy' executable and the
     setuid bit is set.

     CAUTION: this introduces potential security risks.  I tried to
     minimise these, but nevertheless do *not* choose the user `root'
     instead of `games'.  And remember: moon-buggy comes with no
     warranty.


   Example: On GNU/Linux systems you probably can use the following
commands.  For the last one you may need root user permissions.

     ./configure --sharedstatedir=/var/games --with-setuid=games
     make
     make install
