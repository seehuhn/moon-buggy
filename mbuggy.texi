@chapter Introduction

Moon-buggy is a simple character graphics game, where you drive some
kind of car across the moon's surface.  Unfortunately there are
dangerous craters there.  Fortunately your car can jump over them!

The game is not yet finished.  So be prepared to encounter bugs (and
please report them).  But it works to some extent, it has a top-ten
list, and it may be fun.  Just try it!

Moon-Buggy comes with no warranty, to the extent permitted by law.  You
may redistribute copies of Moon-Buggy under the terms of the GNU General
Public License.  For more information about these matters, read the file
@file{COPYING} of the source code distribution or press @key{c} at
moon-buggy's title screen.

Please mail any suggestions and bug reports to
@email{voss@@mathematik.uni-kl.de}.  Your message should include the
moon-buggy version number, as obtained by the command @samp{moon-buggy -V}.


@node  Moon-buggy Invocation, Maint-buggy Invocation, Introduction, Top
@chapter Moon-buggy Invocation

Normal usage is to start @samp{moon-buggy} without any options.
Nevertheless there are some.  The long options (starting with @samp{--})
are only supported on some system types.

@table @samp
@item -h
@itemx --help
shows a short usage message.

@item -n
@itemx --no-title
skips the title screen.

@item -V
@itemx --version
prints the program's version to standard output and exits.
@end table

@chapter Maint-buggy Invocation

The @samp{maint-buggy} script is installed as part of the moon-buggy
package.  It helps you to maintain your moon-buggy installation and is
only useful for the system administrator.

At the moment, its only purpose is to remove moon-buggy from your
system.

The script understands the following options.

@table @samp
@item --help
shows a short usage message.

@item --uninstall
removes the moon-buggy installation from the system.  Use with caution:
As this includes the @file{maint-buggy} script itself, this step cannot
easily be undone!

Note: If you installed moon-buggy with the help of a package manager
(like @code{rpm}) you probably should use the same program for
deinstallation.

@item --version
prints moon-buggy's version string to standard output and exits.
@end table


@node Playing the Game, Shared Score Files, Maint-buggy Invocation, Top
@chapter Playing the Game

Just start it and follow the instructions.  The car is controlled by a
couple of keys.  These are the following.

@table @key
@item SPC
makes your car jump.  The length of a jump is fixed and you can only
start a new jump while the wheels have contact to the ground.
@item a
fires the mining laser.  The laser is used to remove stones, which may
block your way.
@item q
quits the game prematurely.  But you still keep your score and may enter
the top ten list.
@end table

Moon-buggy can handle a wide range of screen sizes.  But it runs best,
if the screen has at least 80 columns.  If you run it on a screen with
significantly less columns it may look strange and could be hard to
play.


@node Shared Score Files, Installation, Playing the Game, Top
@chapter Shared Score Files

The global score file should be writable by the moon-buggy program.
Otherwise each user gets a local score file in his home directory.  Thus
he only sees his own scores and no real competition arises.  But to
achive this goal on a multi-user system is somewhat tricky, because we
have to use the operating system's access controls properly.

One solution is to make the score file world writable, but this opens
the opportunity to cheat.

The other possibility is to make moon-buggy a setuid program.  This
means the following: you choose an user ID, which cannot be used by
ordinary users, and allow only this user to write the score file.  Many
systems have a user @samp{games} for this purpose (Check your
@file{/etc/passwd} file).  Then you make this user own the
@file{moon-buggy} executable and set the file's setuid bit.  This gives
moon-buggy its file owner's access permissions in addition to the
player one's and thus moon-buggy can access the score file.

When you install the program, you can choose, which method to use:
First, you could do nothing about it.  Then the program is installed
without an special privileges and the score file is @emph{not} shared.
You may set the setuid or setgid bit of the executable later on and you
may change the access permissions of the score file, as you like.

Second, you can use @code{configure}'s @samp{--with-setuid} option
(@pxref{Installation}).  This enables setuid usage by default.


@node Installation, References, Shared Score Files, Top
@chapter Installation

Moon-buggy requires the curses library as a prerequisite.  If curses is
not installed on your system, you may use the free ncurses package
(@pxref{References}).

When you unpack the moon-buggy distribution, you get one directory,
which holds all the source files and the documentation.  Now enter this
directory:

@example
cd moon-buggy-@value{VERSION}
@end example

@noindent
If you have built moon-buggy in this directory before, you can use the
command @samp{make distclean} to remove any files, which were created
during the last build.

Generic installation instructions are in the file @file{INSTALL}.
There are some points of interest:

@itemize @bullet
@item
By default, the program will be installed as
@file{/usr/local/bin/moon-buggy}.  You can specify an installation
prefix other than @file{/usr/local} by giving @samp{configure} the
@samp{--prefix=@var{path}} option.

@item
You can choose the score file's location via @code{configure}'s
@samp{--sharedstatedir} option.  On Linux you should use

@example
--sharedstatedir=/var/games
@end example

@noindent
to comply with the Filesystem Hierarchy Standard (@pxref{References}).

@item
Moon-buggy supports shared score files.  For details, see @ref{Shared
Score Files}.  As explained there, you may want to make moon-buggy a
setuid program.  This can be done with the @samp{--with-setuid} option.
If you use

@example
--with-setuid=games
@end example

@noindent
then the user @samp{games} owns the @file{moon-buggy} executable and the
setuid bit is set.

@strong{Caution}: this introduces potential security risks.  I tried to
minimise these, but nevertheless do @strong{not} choose the user
@samp{root} instead of @samp{games}.  And remember: moon-buggy comes
with no warranty.
@end itemize

Example: On GNU/Linux systems you probably can use the following
commands.  For the last one you may need root user permissions.

@example
./configure --sharedstatedir=/var/games --with-setuid=games
make
make install
@end example

Once you do not want this program on your system any more, you can use
the @samp{maint-buggy} script to cleanly remove the package from your
system (@pxref{Maint-buggy Invocation}).
